Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there was a guy named Jim.
He was, all in all, a pretty cool guy.
He had two friends, Oscar and Kevin.
One day, Jim, Oscar and Kevin all walked into bar.
Jim said, "Hey, my name's Jim."
Kevin said, "Hey, my name's Kevin."
Oscar said, "Hey, my name's Oscar."
And then they were friends.
